OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. Starting with 2011, OpenCV features GPU acceleration for real-time operations. 

OpenCV's application areas include:
1.2D and 3D feature toolkits
2.Egomotion estimation
3.Facial recognition system
4.Gesture recognition
5.Object detection
